Sophie and her family went to visit her friend Meredith at the school where Max worked. Meredith decided to take them on a tour of the villages nearby, and her enthusiasm for Max to come with them on the picnic was a curious surprise for all. Sophie and Max talked, ate lots of cheese, discreetly flirted (her mom was there!) and watched Zoe launch herself across a playground from a non-regulation merry-go-round. Max mentioned wanting to see an Alexander Calder exhibit in Paris, which Sophie said she'd like to see as well.</P><p>After Sophie left Villesèque, Max thought about her every day. Little did he know that Sophie was thinking about him too, but couldn't imagine any way in which their paths would cross again. Max waited as long as possible -- about three days -- before calling her to ask if she'd like to see the Calder exhibit with him in Paris. Under the pretense of “already being in Paris,” which was probably rather transparent given that it was across the country and a day away, Max suggested they meet up and Sophie agreed. He took the train from Narbonne up to Paris that next morning and they were having coffee by eleven. They spent the day running around the Pompidou, playing with the children Sophie cared for, hiding from the rain while drinking wine in cafes, and by five-o'clock, they had fallen in love.</p><p>Sophie was beginning school in Montreal a few months later, but they decided to stay together. They spent the next five years writing long letters and spending all their money on trips to see each other while Sophie finished her degree and Max started a career in San Francisco. In January 2014, almost 5 years after they had met, Sophie joined Max in San Francisco, where they now live together on Duboce Park.</p></div></div></section><section class="container content-section text-justify" id="schedule"><div class="row"><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2"><h2>Weekend Schedule</h2><table class="schedule"><tr><td colspan="2"><h4>Friday, June 23, 2017</h4></td></tr><tr><th><h5>Welcome event</h5></th><td><div class="location">TBD</div><strong>8:00 pm</strong> Casual cocktail reception</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><h4>Saturday June 24, 2017</h4></td><tr><th><h5>Wedding!</h5></th><td><div class="location">Chateau de Bouthonvilliers</div><div class="event"><div class="time">3:30 pm</div>Guests arrive</div><div class="event"><div class="time">4:00 pm</div>Ceremony begins</div><div class="event">Cocktail reception, dinner, and dancing to follow</div></td></tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><h4>Sunday June 25, 2017</h4></td><tr><th><h5>Brunch</h5></th><td><div class="location">Chateau de Bouthonvilliers</div><strong>12:00 pm        </strong></td></tr></tr></table></div></div></section><section class="container content-section text-justify" id="attire"><div class="row"><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2"><h2>Attire</h2><p>We love getting dressed up, so semi-formal attire is requested for the wedding.</p><p>Late June in the Eure-et-Loire region generally is in the high 70s during the day, but can cool down at night.

Same goes for any Hotels that are not located in Chateaudun.</li><li>On that note, all of the towns are very small. Chateaudun, which is a small city about 15 minutes from the wedding venue has walkable amenities, so this is a good option if you do not rent a car or prefer to stay in a hotel.</li><li>Uber is not a thing in this area. Local taxis are:<ul><li>Taxi Dunois (+33 2 37 96 66 54)</li><li>Taxi Bernard Deglas (+33 2 37 45 10 64)</li><li>Taxi Allo Samson (+33 2 37 45 30 75)</li></ul></li><li>We are working on providing a shuttle back to chateaudun after the wedding.</li><li>We HIGHLY recommend buying a sim card for your phone once you arrive in France. They are cheap and available in airports and train stations. Big companies are Orange and SFR.</li><li>Here's a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1339513712800472/">Facebook group</a> where you can connect with other people if you're interested in finding other peeps to share a spot with.</li></ul></div></div></section><section class="container content-section text-justify" id="registry"><div class="row"><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2"><h2>Registry</h2><a href="https://www.zola.com/registry/sophieplusmax"><h4>Sophie Plus Max</h4></a></div></div></section><section class="container content-section text-justify" id="rsvp"><div class="row"><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2"><h2>RSVP</h2><p>Please RSVP by March 15th, 2017 <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScOyS84fyHwvd2mgs0ip6bsRP2oiZHe6pVqlxhLTeFxUP2fOQ/viewform">here</a>.</p></div></div></section><script src="/javascripts/all.js"></script></body></html>
